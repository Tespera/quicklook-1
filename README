1. About
--------

Quick Look is a package to collect system statistics and output pretty graphics
and (X)HTML pages. It allows system administrators to have a quick look on the
status of their systems, without going for a more advanced (and heavier)
solution.

Quick Look currently shows...

  * CPU and memory usage
  * Load average and process spawning rates
  * I/O operations
  * Network traffic rates
  * Tracked network connections


2. Requirements
---------------

  * Python 2.3 or newer
  * Cheetah 0.9.16 or newer
  * Linux 2.4.27 or newer, 2.6.8 or newer
  * rrdtool 1.0.49 or newer
  * python-rrd 0.2.1 or newer

Older versions of any of these packages may work, but haven't been tested.


3. Installation
---------------

To install Quick Look into "/opt/quicklook", just run the following commands:

    make DESTDIR=/opt/quicklook install
    cp extras/quicklook.cron /etc/cron.d/quicklook

By default, data files are stored in "/var/opt/quicklook" and webpages are
generated into the "/var/www/quicklook" directory. If you wish to make changes
to the output directories, or you chose a different installation directory, edit
the "quicklook.cron" file before copying it.

Quick Look will now collect data and generate webpages every five minutes. No
other steps are needed, but you can always run "stats.py" without parameters to
check out the options available.


4. Upgrade from 1.0.x
---------------------

When using Quick Look 1.0.x, a reboot could cause some of the graphs to have a
huge spike. To prevent this from happening, the format for some of the data
files (*.rrd) had to be changed.

Newer versions of Quick Look cannot read these files, and they have to be
converted if you wish to keep the data contained in them. To do this, you can
use the "extras/convert.sh" script.

For example, if you are storing data files in "/var/opt/quicklook" (default),
they can be converted with the following command:

    convert.sh /var/opt/quicklook

Backup this directory first, just in case.
